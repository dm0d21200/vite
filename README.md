‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css                         # Global application styles
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Image System

The game uses a smart fallback system for vocabulary images:

1. **Vector Graphics (.svg)**: All words have educational SVG illustrations
2. **Educational Placeholders (.svg)**: Beautiful, color-coded SVG graphics for each word
3. **Dynamic Fallback**: Canvas-generated placeholders as final fallback

The game automatically uses .svg files, or creates a dynamic placeholder if needed. All 130 vocabulary words have educational SVG placeholders included.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **View the Question**: You'll see an image and the question "What is this?"
2. **Choose Your Answer**: Select the correct word from 4 multiple choice options
3. **Get Feedback**: Your selection will be highlighted as correct (green) or incorrect (red)
4. **Hear Audio**: Enjoy celebratory sounds for correct answers
5. **Track Progress**: Watch your score and progress bar as you advance
6. **Complete & Repeat**: Finish all questions to see your final score and play again

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **CSS3** with modern features (Grid, Flexbox, Gradients)
- **Web Audio API** for sound effects
- **SVG Graphics** for educational placeholders
- **Dynamic Question Generation** from JSON vocabulary data

## üìä Game Statistics

- **130 Total Vocabulary Words** across 10 categories
- **15 Questions per Game** (randomly selected and shuffled)
- **Smart Image System** with multiple fallback options
- **Category-Based Learning** with color-coded themes
- **Responsive Design** works on desktop and mobile

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Customizing Vocabulary

To modify the vocabulary or add new categories:

1. Edit `src/data/kids_vocabulary_ages_5_6.json`
2. Add new categories or words following the existing structure
3. The game will automatically include new vocabulary in question generation

### Customizing Game Behavior

You can modify game settings in `src/data/questions.ts`:

```typescript
// Change number of questions per game (currently 15)
return shuffledQuestions.slice(0, 20); // Change to 20 questions

// Modify words per category (currently 2)
const selectedWords = getRandomItems(words, Math.min(3, words.length)); // Change to 3
```

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run preview         # Preview production build
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
```

## üéØ Educational Value

This game is designed for kids ages 5-6 and provides:

- **Visual Learning**: Image-based questions help with word association
- **Category Organization**: Vocabulary grouped by logical themes
- **Immediate Feedback**: Instant visual and audio feedback
- **Progress Tracking**: Motivating progress indicators and scoring
- **Repetitive Learning**: Different word combinations each game session
